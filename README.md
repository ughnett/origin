Origin
===

Origin is a blank WordPress starter theme. Origin uses Bower to manage packages and Grunt as a task runner.

There are almost as many starter themes as there are developers in the WordPress ecosystem but regardless of which ones I try, I always find myself tweaking it or re-tooling it in some way -- so I created Origin.


### Getting Started

To start, `cd/to/origin`

Install front-end packages by running:

``
$ bower install
``

Install Grunt dependencies by running:

``
$ npm install
``

Watch for changes and compile Sass/Js run:

``
$ grunt watch
``
